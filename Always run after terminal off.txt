if port run type error 

The error message you received indicates that the Ollama service is trying to bind to port 11434, but it is already in use by another instance of the Ollama process. Specifically, the output from lsof -i :11434 shows that the command ollama is already listening on that port.
Steps to Resolve the Issue
Stop the Existing Ollama Process:
Since the port is already in use, you need to stop the existing Ollama process. You can do this with the following command:
bash
sudo kill 12647

Replace 12647 with the actual PID (Process ID) shown in your lsof output.
Verify the Port is Free:
After stopping the process, check if the port is free:
bash
sudo lsof -i :11434

If there are no results, it means the port is now free.
Restart the Ollama Service:
Now that the port is available, you can restart the Ollama service:
bash
sudo systemctl restart ollama.service

Check Service Status:
Verify that the service is running correctly:
bash
sudo systemctl status ollama.service
